        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Our Status</h2>
        <p>
          Borrowww is not a bank or NBFC and does not provide loans or accept
          deposits. We act as a loan advisory and facilitation platform connecting users with
          regulated lenders.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. Working with Regulated Lenders</h2>
        <p>
          We cooperate with RBI-regulated banks and NBFCs. Loan decisions, charges, and interest
          rates are determined solely by these institutions as per their policies.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          We avoid misleading claims such as guaranteed approvals, fixed timelines, or assured
          interest rates. All final loan terms are decided by lenders.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share user information without consent. Data handling follows reasonable
          security practices. KYC is performed only by banks/NBFCs in compliance with RBI
          guidelines.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. Fair Practices</h2>
        <p>
          We promote fair communication and do not encourage mis-selling or false representations.
          Users are advised to verify loan terms before proceeding.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">6. Grievance Redressal</h2>
